          Hi, I'm Dylan Lewis - a full-time honors student studying Software
          Development. I am committed to solving complex problems and delivering
          intuitive, long-lasting solutions. I develop software that's not only
          functional, but also provides genuine business value. My dedication to
          writing clean, maintainable code supports scalability and ease of
          management over time. Whether I'm working independently or
          collaborating on a team, I thrive in environments that challenge me to
          think critically, remain diligent, and push the boundaries of what I
          can create.
